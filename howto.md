## How to use SniffSift

## Downloading

Run `git clone https://github.com/mhendy25/offline_network_traffic_analyzer.git` to download the project to your desired destination

In the downloaded files, there will be a few important files. One is the `readme.md` file that will give a detailed description of our project.

Our project has commands like `ls`, `pwd`, and `cd` to allow users to navigate through their file system.


## Running the program in the command line
1. Go to the downloaded project location in the terminal.
2. To run the program use the following command `./cli_tool [.txt file]`. This will read the hex dump and print out the contents.
3. Alternatively, you can just run `./cli_tool` which will open the program where you can then navigate through your directories to find the desired file.

## Running the executable (MacOS ONLY)
1. You can run the executable file called `cli_tool` by double-clicking the executable. Then you can read any file in your directory to start sniffing!
